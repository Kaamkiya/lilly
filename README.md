| the code presented here is not valid at all, I ran `cat view.v | shuf >> view.v` a bunch of times to get a huge file

# What?

This project is the home of a custom TUI based text editor. This is intended to replace Neovim as my daily driver once it is sufficiently feature complete.

# Why?
 I have Neovim configured exactly how I like it at this point, and I do not find myself altering the configurations very often. I figured that it might be better for me to have an editor which just implements all
 of my desired features as part of the core project, rather than relying on a huge ecosystem of Lua plugins/scripts/configs.
 
 It is already proving to be more performant than Neovim on huge files for example.
 Other editors exist which provide an "IDE" experience with VIM bindings, such as VSCode or Sublime Text, but these are first and foremost graphical user interface programs and therefore do not suit my needs.
